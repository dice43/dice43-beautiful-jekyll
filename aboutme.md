## About Me

Hi, my name is Miguel Jones! I am a computer science graduate from the William & Mary who has always been fascinated by learning about new technology and experimenting with it to understand its inner workings. 
With how dependent we have become on technology in our daily lives, I often find myself asking why certain things work. 
How is our connectivity so fast all the time?, Why is that program so efficient?, etc. 

I am proficient in programming web-based applications and have extensive experience working with JavaScript, React, and CSS/HTML. I enjoy finding new ways to improve enjoyment for users interacting with websites. 
I had the opportunity to develop my skills in this area through the tech developer internship with SEO and in my work as a web designer. 
I have also gained knowledge of how networks function and the security practices necessary to keep them safe from malicious actors. 
This knowledge has served me well in becoming certified by CompTIA, passing the Network+ and Security+ exams.
