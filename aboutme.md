## About Me

I am a graduating senior studying computer science at the College of William & Mary. <img src="/assets/img/wmlogo.png" alt="WM" style="height:1.5em;">

I have learned a great deal about topics in software engineering such as, multiple programming languages, APIs, SQL/Databases, Frontend frameworks (REACT & FLASK), and much more through my work with SEO <img src="/assets/img/seologo.png" alt="SEO" style="height:1.5em;"> during their tech development(2021) and open source development(2022) programs respectively.

When I'm not working on different projects I like to work out, read, and cook.
