## [Record_Receipts](https://github.com/dice43/Record_Receipts)
Record_Receipts is an app that can be used to track a user’s budget across many different categories. The user may take a photo of their receipt with the camera and save an image of it to the app’s persistent internal storage. The image is then processed with machine learning OCR text recognition to automatically retrieve the total amount of the receipt and the name of the establishment. The user selects a category for the receipt to be saved into, like “gas”, “dining”, “grocery”, etc. and the receipt is stored in that directory while the amount total spent is saved.
